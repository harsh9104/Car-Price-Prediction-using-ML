Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as brand, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more. The model is trained using Machine Learning techniques like Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.




Dataset Features:

1.Car Brand

2.Year

3.Sold Price

4.Present Price

5.K/Ms Driven

6.Fuel Type

7.Seller Type

8.Transmission Type

9.Owners



Workflow :

The project follows the below workflow:


Training Phase

Car Data: Load the dataset and analyze it.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical data.

Train/Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training:

Train a Linear Regression Model.

Train a Lasso Regression Model.

 
Testing Phase

New Data: Input new car details.

Trained Model: Use the trained Linear & Lasso Regression models.

Car Price Prediction: Predict the estimated price of the car.
